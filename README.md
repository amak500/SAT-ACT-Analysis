**Recommendations:**

Given the fact that more and more states are making either the SAT or the ACT mandatory, I suggest that we focus on lobbying the state education boards that have not yet decided on either test in order to convince them to make the SAT their primary test. Additionally, in order to counteract the drop in scores that might happen because of the increased population that comes with mandatory SAT testing, I suggest that we subsidize states that haven't yet converted with free PSAT testing and further emphasize our partnership with Khan Academy and the free SAT test prep they provide. Wisconsin, which had 7000 students graduating this year, could be a good testbed, due to its relatively small graduating class size.
